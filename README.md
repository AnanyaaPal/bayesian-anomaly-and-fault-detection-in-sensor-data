## Bayesian Activity Anomaly (and Fault) Detection Using Wearable Sensor Data

Project carried out as a part of the graded module: 
On the Theory and Practice of Monte Carlo Simulations 

Further, it is classified as an application-oriented topic.

The goal is to implement MCMC for Naïve Bayes classification to the following binary classfication dataset. 

### Goal of the project: Detect movement vs no movement from the sensor data.
In the dataset, there are 6 ADL (Activities of Daily Living) - Standing, Sitting, Laying Down, Walking, Walking Upstairs and Walking Downstairs. 

Of these 6 ADLs, one can define:
- Static Activites: Standing, Sitting, Laying Down
- Dynamic Activities: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs

Detailed information about the dataset can be found [here](data/README.txt).
